A CouchApp that indexes BuildBot builds

Get your BuildBot build slaves to fire a document like below for each unit test that
fails.

{
    "test_name": test_name, 
    "builder": builder, 
    "timestamp": timestamp, 
    "bld_id": build_id, 
    "step": step,
    "reason": reason
}

 * test_name: the test that has failed
 * builder: the name of the build slave
 * timestamp: when the test failed
 * bld_id: the id of the build
 * step: the build step that failed
 * reason: the failure message
